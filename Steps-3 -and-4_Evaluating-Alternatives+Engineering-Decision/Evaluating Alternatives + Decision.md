**Criteria: simplicity, safety, and reliability.**
Decision: A3 (Directional, multi-zone with obstacle detection)

Simplicity: still falls within simple boolean input/output.

Safety:directional near/far detection minimises premature gate opening. More sensors address single point failures. Insures cars cant be trapped on the tracks.

Reliability: reading incoming and outgoing makes the system reliably quick and efficient for users.
