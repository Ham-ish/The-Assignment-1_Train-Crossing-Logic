**Brainstorm at least two different logic-based solutions.**

A1 — “Always-open default with near/far train detectors”
Gates normally up. Two train detectors each side (far approach & near). Near → drop gates; far → pre-warn.
Pros: Minimizes average road delay; simple to reason about.
Cons: Without directionality you may close unnecessarily for cleared trains; needs obstacle detection to avoid trapping vehicles.


A2 — “Normally-closed, open on demand”
Gates down by default. Open only when no train and a car requests passage.
Pros: Strong fail-safe posture.
Cons: Causes long queues and community pushback; more cycles = more mechanical wear; risky if an approaching train appears while a platoon is passing.


A3 — “Directional, multi-zone with obstacle detection (chosen)”
Gate default state is up. Directional sensors create far-approach, near-approach, and crossing blocks;. and checks whether the train is incoming or outgoing using the previous sets of detection. If a train is incoming, a warning is shown to incoming cars, then when the train is closer, the gate closes, and stays closed until the train is outgoing and a sufficient distance away from the gate. Car detection on track opens the gate if a car is detected so cars cannot be trapped
Pros: Robust timing, direction awareness, supports sanity checks, integrates obstacle protection.
Cons: More sensors and logic; needs calibration.
